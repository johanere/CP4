Project 4 in FYS3150


Note added on Friday the 23: 
While doing the dishes today it suddenly struck me that I forgot to change <.M> to <|M|> in the program when calculating chi in the last part of the project - and a quick check of the figures in the report confirmed this, which frustrates me alot as I used quite a lot of time in general on the project. Although the resolution in temperature would have been the same, it might have been possible to draw more robust conlusions with respect to expected behaviour around the Curie temperature.
