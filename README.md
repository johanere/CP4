Project 4 in FYS3150


Note added on Friday the 23: 
While doing the dishes today it suddenly struck me that I forgot to change <M> to <|M|> in calculating chi in the last part of the project, which really frustrated me as I used quite a lot of time in general on the project. I belive that the resolution might still have been too poor, but I'm not entriely sure. A comment on this would be very welcome (other than the fact that I forgot to change <M> to <|M|>.
